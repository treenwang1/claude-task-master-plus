# Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
This is a sample PRD document to test the new tabbed interface in the TaskMaster VS Code extension.

## Goals and Objectives
- Test the PRD document editing functionality
- Verify markdown parsing capabilities
- Ensure proper tab switching between metadata and document views

## Features and Requirements

### Core Features
- **Tabbed Interface**: Seamless switching between PRD metadata and document views
- **Markdown Editor**: Full-featured markdown editing for PRD documents
- **Auto-Save**: Automatic saving of document changes
- **Parse Integration**: Direct parsing from markdown content to generate tasks

### Technical Features
- React-based component architecture
- VS Code webview integration
- File system integration for `.taskmaster/{taskGroup}/docs/prd.md`

## Technical Specifications
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, React, VS Code Extension API
- **File Format**: Markdown (.md)
- **Storage Location**: `.taskmaster/{taskGroup}/docs/prd.md` in workspace
- **Integration**: TaskMaster core parsing engine

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to edit PRD content in markdown format so that I can leverage familiar syntax
- As a project manager, I want to switch between structured metadata and free-form document views
- As a user, I want to parse my PRD directly from the document tab to generate tasks

## Success Criteria
- Tab switching works smoothly without data loss
- Markdown content is properly saved to `.taskmaster/{taskGroup}/docs/prd.md`
- Parsing functionality works from both metadata and document tabs
- UI is responsive and intuitive

## Implementation Notes
- Uses VS Code webview messaging for data synchronization
- Supports both structured metadata (YAML-like) and free-form markdown
- Integrated with existing TaskMaster parsing infrastructure
- Task group-specific file storage maintains project organization

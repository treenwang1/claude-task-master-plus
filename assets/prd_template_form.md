## Instructions for AI Generation:
Once you've filled out this template, provide it to an AI with the following prompt:

*"Please generate a comprehensive Software Product Requirements Document based on the filled template below. Expand each section with detailed technical specifications, include user stories and acceptance criteria where appropriate, add technical architecture diagrams descriptions, and ensure the document is actionable for a software development team. The final PRD should be 4-6 pages and include all necessary technical details for successful software development, including API specifications, database schemas, and deployment requirements."*

This template is specifically designed for software products and includes the technical depth needed for development teams while remaining concise enough for efficient completion.
